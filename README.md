## 📘 Overview  

**ElectroRescue AI** is an advanced PCB (Printed Circuit Board) analysis platform powered by computer vision and AI models.  
By simply uploading a PCB image, users receive an intelligent, automated breakdown of:

- ✔ Component identification  
- ✔ Damage & defect detection  
- ✔ Part-number OCR  
- ✔ Component condition grading  
- ✔ Salvage value estimation  
- ✔ Structured reports  

The mission is simple: **Reduce e-waste by helping users reuse, repair, and re-grow electronics.**

## 🚀 How It Works  

1. **Upload a PCB Image**  
   Add a clear image of your PCB using the upload module.

2. **AI Begins Processing**  
   The system detects components, identifies damage, extracts text, and calculates values.

3. **Detailed Report is Generated**  
   Includes list of components, ratings, valuations, and repair suggestions.

4. **Generate a Project**  
   Use your components to explore AI-recommended DIY electronics projects.

5. **Saved to History**  
   Each report is automatically stored for later review.
